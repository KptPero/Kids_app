    text: `Once upon a time, there were three bears who lived in a cozy little house in the forest. There was great big Papa Bear, medium-sized Mama Bear, and tiny little Baby Bear. One morning, Mama Bear made a big pot of delicious porridge for breakfast. But the porridge was too hot to eat! So the three bears decided to go for a walk in the forest while their porridge cooled down.\n\nWhile they were away, a little girl named Goldilocks was walking through the forest. She had beautiful golden curly hair and a bright red dress. Goldilocks saw the bears' house and peeked through the window. Nobody was home! She opened the door and walked right inside.\n\nFirst, Goldilocks saw the three bowls of porridge on the table. She tasted Papa Bear's porridge. "Ouch! This porridge is too hot!" she cried. Then she tasted Mama Bear's porridge. "Brrr! This porridge is too cold!" she said. Then she tasted Baby Bear's porridge. "Mmmm! This porridge is just right!" she smiled, and she ate it all up.\n\nNext, Goldilocks wanted to sit down. She sat in Papa Bear's big chair. "This chair is too hard!" she said. She sat in Mama Bear's chair. "This chair is too soft!" she said. She sat in Baby Bear's little chair. "This chair is just right!" But then CRACK! The chair broke into pieces!\n\nGoldilocks was feeling sleepy, so she went upstairs. She tried Papa Bear's bed. "This bed is too hard!" She tried Mama Bear's bed. "This bed is too soft!" She tried Baby Bear's bed. "This bed is just right!" And she fell fast asleep.\n\nSoon the three bears came home. "Someone's been eating my porridge!" growled Papa Bear. "Someone's been eating MY porridge!" said Mama Bear. "Someone's been eating my porridge, and they ate it ALL up!" cried Baby Bear sadly.\n\nThey found Baby Bear's broken chair. Then they went upstairs and found Goldilocks sleeping in Baby Bear's bed! When Goldilocks saw the three bears, she jumped up and ran home as fast as she could. And she never went into anyone's house without asking again!`

    text: `Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who were all grown up and ready to build their own houses. Their mother kissed them goodbye and said, "Remember, work hard and build strong houses to keep you safe!"\n\nThe first little pig was very lazy. He wanted to play all day long! So he built his house out of straw. It was quick and easy, and he spent the rest of the day dancing and singing. "La la la! My house is done! Now I can have fun!"\n\nThe second little pig worked a bit harder. He built his house out of sticks. It took a little longer, but he still had time to play in the afternoon. "My house is nice and strong!" he said happily.\n\nThe third little pig was very wise. He worked all day long building his house out of strong red bricks. He mixed the cement very carefully and placed each brick just right. His brothers laughed at him. "Why are you working so hard? Come play with us!" But the third pig just smiled and kept building.\n\nOne day, a big bad wolf came to the forest. He was very hungry! He went to the first pig's straw house. "Little pig, little pig, let me come in!" growled the wolf. "Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!" squealed the pig. "Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll BLOW your house down!" And the wolf blew the straw house right down! The first pig ran to his brother's stick house.\n\nThe wolf followed and called, "Little pigs, let me come in!" "Not by the hair on our chinny chin chins!" they cried. "Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll BLOW your house down!" And the wolf blew the stick house down too! Both pigs ran to their brother's brick house.\n\nThe wolf went to the brick house. He huffed and he puffed, but he could NOT blow the brick house down! He tried again and again. He even tried climbing down the chimney. But the smart third pig had put a big pot of hot water at the bottom! The wolf ran away and was never seen again.\n\nThe two pigs thanked their brother. From that day on, all three pigs lived happily and safely in the strong brick house.`

    text: `Once upon a time, in a green and sunny meadow, there lived a speedy hare and a slow tortoise. The hare was always bragging about how fast he could run. "I'm the fastest animal in the whole world!" he would say, hopping around the meadow showing off. "Nobody can ever beat me in a race!"\n\nThe tortoise heard the hare bragging again one sunny morning. Even though he was very slow, the tortoise was a brave and wise creature. "I will race you," said the tortoise calmly. All the animals in the meadow gasped! The hare laughed so hard he fell over. "You? Race ME? That's the funniest thing I've ever heard! But okay, let's do it!"\n\nThe next morning, all the animals gathered to watch the big race. The fox held up a flag and shouted, "Ready, set, GO!" The hare zoomed off like a rocket while the tortoise slowly put one foot in front of the other. Step by step by step.\n\nThe hare ran so far ahead that he couldn't even see the tortoise anymore. "This is too easy!" laughed the hare. He sat down under a big oak tree. "I'm so far ahead, I can take a little nap." He yawned and closed his eyes. Soon he was fast asleep, dreaming about winning trophies.\n\nMeanwhile, the tortoise kept going. He didn't stop, and he didn't quit. He walked past the flowers. He walked past the stream. He walked past the sleeping hare under the oak tree. "One step at a time," the tortoise said to himself. "Just keep going."\n\nThe sun moved across the sky. The hare slept and slept. When he finally woke up, he stretched and yawned. "Better finish this easy race!" he chuckled. But when he looked toward the finish line, he could not believe his eyes!\n\nThe tortoise was almost at the finish line! The hare ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. The tortoise crossed the finish line first! All the animals cheered and celebrated.\n\nThe tortoise smiled and said, "Slow and steady wins the race." The hare learned an important lesson that day: hard work and never giving up are more important than being the fastest. And he never bragged again.`

    text: `Once upon a time, a mother duck sat on her nest by a beautiful lake. She was waiting for her eggs to hatch. One by one, the eggs cracked open. "Quack! Quack!" said the little ducklings as they came out into the world. They were fluffy and yellow and adorable.\n\nBut one egg, the biggest egg, had not hatched yet. Mother Duck waited patiently. Finally, CRACK! Out came the last duckling. He was bigger than the others, with grey feathers instead of yellow. "He doesn't look like us," the other ducklings whispered.\n\nAs the days went by, the grey duckling felt very sad. The other ducklings wouldn't play with him. "You're too big! You're too grey! You're ugly!" they said. Even the farm animals were unkind. The chickens pecked at him, and the turkeys chased him.\n\nThe poor duckling decided to run away. He walked and walked through fields and forests. When it rained, he was cold and wet. When it was windy, he shivered by himself. He saw beautiful wild ducks, but they flew away. He saw graceful white swans gliding across a pond, and he thought they were the most beautiful creatures he had ever seen.\n\nWinter came and it was very cold. The duckling found shelter near a frozen pond. He was lonely and sad, but he never gave up hope. "Maybe one day things will be better," he told himself as he curled up to keep warm.\n\nFinally, spring arrived! The flowers bloomed, birds sang, and the sun warmed everything up. The duckling stretched his wings. Something felt different. He felt stronger! He flew up into the air and landed on a beautiful lake.\n\nWhen he looked down at his reflection in the water, he could not believe what he saw. He was no longer a grey, clumsy duckling. He had become a beautiful, graceful swan! His feathers were pure white and his neck was long and elegant.\n\nThe other swans glided over to him. "Welcome! You're so beautiful!" they said. Some children by the lake pointed and said, "Look at that new swan! He's the most beautiful swan of all!"\n\nThe young swan felt so happy. He remembered all the sad times, but none of that mattered now. He had found where he belonged. He lifted his head proudly and glided across the sparkling water, the happiest swan in the whole world.`

One day, Jack's mother said sadly, "We have no more money and no food. You must take Milky White to market and sell her."\n\nOn the way to market, Jack met a funny old man. "I'll give you these magic beans for your cow!" said the old man, holding out five colorful beans. Jack thought they looked wonderful, so he traded the cow for the beans.\n\nWhen Jack showed his mother the beans, she was very upset. "Magic beans? Oh, Jack!" She threw the beans out the window, and they both went to bed hungry and sad.\n\nBut in the morning, Jack looked out the window and gasped! A giant beanstalk had grown during the night. It was enormous, stretching up through the clouds so high he couldn't see the top! Jack began to climb. He climbed and climbed until he reached a land above the clouds.\n\nThere stood an enormous castle! Jack tiptoed inside and found a giant's kitchen. Everything was huge! The table was as big as a house, and the chairs were taller than trees. Jack found golden coins on the table and put them in his pocket.\n\nSuddenly, the ground shook. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! A giant was coming! "Fee-fi-fo-fum!" roared the giant in a voice like thunder. Jack quickly hid inside a teacup. The giant ate his enormous dinner and then fell asleep.\n\nJack jumped out of the teacup, grabbed more gold coins, and climbed back down the beanstalk as fast as he could. His mother was so happy to see the gold!\n\nJack climbed the beanstalk two more times. Once he brought home a hen that laid golden eggs! The second time, he found a magical golden harp that played beautiful music all by itself.\n\nBut the giant woke up and chased Jack down the beanstalk! The whole beanstalk shook as the giant climbed down. "Quick, Mother! Bring me the axe!" Jack shouted. Jack chopped and chopped at the beanstalk. TIMBER! The beanstalk came crashing down, and the giant fell far, far away, never to be seen again.\n\nWith the golden hen and the magical harp, Jack and his mother were never poor again. They lived happily ever after in their little cottage, which they fixed up to be the coziest home in the village.`

"I wish I could touch the moon," whispered Bramble, his dark eyes sparkling with wonder.\n\nBramble's mother smiled gently. "The moon is very far away, little one. But you can always wish upon it." Bramble closed his eyes and made a wish. He wished he could fly up to the moon and dance among the stars.\n\nThat night, as Bramble curled up in his warm den, he had the most wonderful dream. In his dream, a gentle moonbeam reached down from the sky like a glowing ladder. Bramble climbed up the moonbeam, one soft step at a time, higher and higher into the night sky.\n\nThe stars twinkled all around him, winking like tiny fireflies. "Hello, little bear!" they said in tinkling voices. "Come and play with us!" Bramble giggled and danced from star to star. Each one felt warm and sparkly under his paws.\n\nWhen he reached the moon, Bramble was amazed. The moon was soft and silvery, like the most comfortable pillow in the world. He lay down on its gentle surface and looked at the world below. He could see forests and rivers and little houses with lights in the windows.\n\n"The world is so beautiful from up here," Bramble said softly. The moon smiled at him. "Every night, I look down and watch over all the sleeping creatures. I keep them company while they dream."\n\n"That's very kind of you," said Bramble. "Don't you ever get lonely?" The moon's glow brightened. "How could I be lonely? I have all the stars to talk to, and every child who looks up at me from their window becomes my friend."\n\nBramble yawned a big bear yawn. The moon gently rocked him like a cradle. "Time to sleep now, little bear. I'll watch over you." The stars sang a soft lullaby, their light dimming to a gentle twinkle.\n\nWhen Bramble woke up in the morning, he was back in his warm den with his mother. The sunlight streamed through the entrance. Was it real or was it a dream? Bramble wasn't sure. But when he found a tiny sparkle of stardust on his paw, he smiled the biggest smile.\n\nEvery night after that, Bramble would look up at the moon before he fell asleep. And every time, the moon seemed to glow just a little bit brighter, as if it were saying, "Goodnight, little bear. Sweet dreams."`

He had carried passengers to the city, delivered letters to the countryside, and brought fresh milk from the farm. Now the sun was going down, painting the sky in beautiful orange and pink.\n\n"Time to head home," yawned Puffles. He chuffed along the tracks, going slower and slower as the evening got darker and the stars began to peek out. The tracks made a gentle rhythm: clickety-clack, clickety-clack, like a lullaby sung by the rails.\n\nFirst, Puffles passed through the Lavender Fields. The purple flowers waved gently in the evening breeze, filling the air with the sweetest smell. "Goodnight, flowers," whispered Puffles, and the flowers seemed to bow sleepily in reply.\n\nNext, Puffles crossed over the Moonlit Bridge. Below, the river sparkled with reflections of stars. A family of ducks was settling down for the night. "Goodnight, ducks," tooted Puffles softly. "Quack, goodnight!" they called back, tucking their heads under their wings.\n\nPuffles chugged through the Whispering Woods. The tall trees made a gentle shushing sound in the breeze. Owls blinked their big eyes from the branches. "Hoo, hoo, goodnight, Puffles," said the wise old owl. A family of rabbits was already sleeping in their burrow.\n\nThen Puffles went past the Cozy Village. Through the windows, he could see families having dinner, children being read bedtime stories, and little puppies curled up on warm rugs. One by one, the lights in the houses turned off as everyone went to sleep.\n\nFinally, Puffles reached the train station. His friend, the old red train named Rusty, was already parked and sleeping. "Goodnight, Rusty," said Puffles quietly. Rusty just snored softly in reply.\n\nPuffles pulled into his cozy shed. The station master covered him with a warm blanket. "You did a wonderful job today, Puffles. Time to rest now." Puffles let out one last quiet puff of steam and closed his headlight eyes.\n\nAnd as the moon rose high in the sky, the little blue train dreamed happy dreams about all the wonderful places he would go tomorrow. Clickety-clack, clickety-clack... goodnight, little train. Goodnight.`

    text: `In a hole in the wall of an old farmhouse lived a tiny brown mouse named Milo. He was the smallest mouse in his family, and sometimes the other mice teased him. "Little Milo, you're too tiny to do anything brave!" they would say.\n\nBut Milo had a big, brave heart. He dreamed of going on great adventures and helping others. One day, his chance came. His big sister Rosie had lost her favorite ribbon. "It blew away toward the garden!" she cried. "But the garden is where the big orange cat sleeps! No mouse dares go there!"\n\nMilo stood up tall, which wasn't very tall at all. "I'll get your ribbon, Rosie!" All the mice gasped. "But Milo, the cat!" they squeaked. "Marmalade the cat has huge claws and sharp teeth!" But Milo had already made up his mind.\n\nMilo crept out of the hole in the wall and tiptoed across the kitchen floor. He was careful to stay in the shadows. Past the refrigerator, under the table, around the chair legs. His tiny heart was beating fast, but he kept going.\n\nWhen he reached the garden door, he squeezed through the gap. The garden was enormous! Giant sunflowers towered above him like skyscrapers. The grass was like a jungle. And there, sleeping on the warm stone path, was Marmalade the cat.\n\nMilo spotted the ribbon! It was caught on a rose bush, right behind Marmalade. Milo took a deep breath. He crept along the flower bed, hiding behind pots and stones. He was so quiet that even the butterflies didn't notice him.\n\nVery carefully, Milo reached the rose bush. He tugged the ribbon free with his tiny paws. Got it! But then—oh no! A leaf crunched under his foot. Marmalade opened one eye.\n\nMilo didn't panic. He remembered something his grandfather had told him: "Being brave doesn't mean you're not scared. It means you keep going even when you are." Quick as a flash, Milo darted behind a flowerpot, then under a watering can, then through a crack in the garden wall.\n\nHe ran all the way back home with the ribbon in his mouth. When he burst through the hole in the wall, all the mice cheered! Rosie hugged him tight. "Thank you, Milo! You're the bravest mouse ever!"\n\nFrom that day on, nobody ever called Milo too tiny again. They called him Milo the Brave. And whenever anyone in the mouse family needed help, they knew exactly who to ask.`
